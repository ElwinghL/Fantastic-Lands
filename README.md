### System

How it works :

> Play your charachter from the __RP__ chan. When you have to do an action that is not trivial, launch a d100

> If your score is inferior to your stat it's a success else, it's a failure

> If your score is equal to one then it's a critical success -> Yeah !

> If your score is equal to 100 then it's a critical failure -> Heck !

Also remember :

> All the players are at the same time players and game master. You have to help, block or bother the others to make the adventure worth to play.
